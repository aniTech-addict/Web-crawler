Scaling this to a Industry level project:

Here's what a web crawler project built for a company might look like, expanding on the concepts we have:

1. __Architecture:__

   - __Distributed System:__ Instead of a single script, it would likely be a distributed system running on multiple servers or containers. This allows for parallel processing and handling a much larger volume of pages.

   - __Message Queue:__ A message queue (like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or SQS) would be used to manage the crawl queue. Crawler instances would pull URLs from the queue, process them, and potentially add new URLs back to the queue.

   - __Separate Components:__ The system would be broken down into distinct services or components:

     - __Scheduler:__ Decides which URLs to crawl and when.
     - __Fetcher/Downloader:__ Handles making HTTP requests, respecting rate limits and politeness rules.
     - __Parser/Scraper:__ Extracts data from the downloaded HTML. This part needs to be highly flexible to handle different website structures.
     - __Data Storage:__ Stores the extracted data.
     - __URL Management:__ Manages the crawl queue, visited URLs, and potentially prioritizes URLs.

2. __Robustness and Error Handling:__

   - __Retry Mechanisms:__ Implement logic to retry failed requests (e.g., due to network errors or temporary server issues) with exponential backoff.
   - __Dead Letter Queues:__ URLs that consistently fail after multiple retries might be moved to a "dead letter queue" for later analysis.
   - __Error Monitoring and Alerting:__ Integrate with monitoring systems (like Prometheus, Datadog) and alerting tools (like PagerDuty, Slack) to notify operators immediately when errors occur (e.g., high rate of failed requests, parsing errors).

3. __Data Storage:__

   - __Databases:__ Instead of just printing, data would be stored in a database. The type of database depends on the data structure and query needs (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for flexible schemas, Elasticsearch for search).
   - __Data Format:__ Data would be stored in a structured format like JSON, Parquet, or Avro.
   - __Data Pipeline:__ The extracted data might go through a data pipeline for cleaning, transformation, and loading into a data warehouse or analytics platform.

4. __Configuration and Management:__

   - __Centralized Configuration:__ Use a configuration management system (like environment variables, config files, or a dedicated service like Consul) to manage settings like crawl depth, time limits, rate limits per domain, user agents, etc.

   - __Admin Interface/API:__ A web-based admin interface or an API might be built to:

     - Start, stop, and monitor crawls.
     - View crawl statistics (pages crawled, errors, data volume).
     - Manage scraping rules.
     - Inspect failed URLs.

5. __Scraping Logic:__

   - __Selectors:__ Use more advanced and robust methods for selecting data, like CSS selectors or XPath, often managed externally to the code.
   - __Dynamic Content:__ Handle websites that load content dynamically using JavaScript. This might require integrating with headless browsers (like Puppeteer or Playwright), similar to the `browser_action` tool we have access to.
   - __Scraping Rules:__ Define scraping rules externally (e.g., in configuration files or a database) rather than hardcoding them, making it easier to adapt to website changes.

6. __Politeness and Ethics:__

   - __`robots.txt` Parsing:__ Automatically fetch and respect the `robots.txt` file of each website to understand which paths are disallowed and what the crawl delay should be.
   - __Rate Limiting:__ Implement per-domain rate limiting to avoid hitting servers too hard.
   - __User Agents:__ Use descriptive user agents.

7. __Testing:__

   - __Unit Tests:__ Test individual functions (fetching, parsing, URL handling).
   - __Integration Tests:__ Test the interaction between different components.
   - __Scraping Tests:__ Regularly test scraping rules against target websites to detect when website structure changes break the scraper.
